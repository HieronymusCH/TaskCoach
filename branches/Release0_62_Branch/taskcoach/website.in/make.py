        <P>%(name)s is a simple open source todo manager to manage personal 
        tasks and todo lists. It grew out of my frustration that well-known 
        task managers, such as those provided with Outlook or Lotus Notes, do
        not provide facilities for composite tasks. Often, tasks and
        other things todo consist of several activities. %(name)s is
        designed to deal with composite tasks.</P>
        <P>Currently, %(name)s is at version %(version)s. I use it on a daily
        basis, but there are still a lot of features missing. If there's

        <UL>
            <LI>Creating, editing, and deleting tasks and subtasks.
            <LI>Tasks have a subject, description, priority, start date, 
            due date, a completion date and an optional reminder.
            <LI>Tasks can be viewed as a list or as a tree.
            <LI>Tasks can be sorted by all task attributes, e.g. subject,
            budget, budget left, due date, etc.
            <LI>Several filters to e.g. hide completed tasks or view
            only tasks that are due today. 
            <LI>Task status depends on its subtask and vice versa. E.g. if 
            you mark the last uncompleted subtask as completed, the parent 
            task is automatically marked as completed too.
            <LI>Tasks can be assigned to user-defined categories. 
            <LI>Settings are persistent and saved automatically. The
            last opened file is loaded automatically when starting
            %(name)s.
            <LI>Tracking time spent on tasks. Tasks can have a budget. 
            Time spent can be viewed by individual effort period, by day, 
            by week, and by month.
            <LI>The %(name)s file format (.tsk) is XML. 
            <LI>Tasks can be exported to HTML. Effort can be exported to
            XML and iCalendar/ICS format.
            <LI>Tasks, effort and categories can be printed. When printing, 
            %(name)s prints the information that is visible in the current
            view, including any filters and sort order. 
            <LI>%(name)s can be run from a removable medium.
        </UL>
        <H3>Missing features</H3>
        <P>The main features that are currently missing are:

            <A HREF="messages.pot"><TT>messages.pot</TT></A>. This file
            contains all text strings to be translated.
            <LI>Rename <TT>messages.pot</TT> into <TT>yourlanguage.po</TT>.
            <LI>Start poEdit and load <TT>yourlanguage.po</TT> and

            <A HREF="http://docs.python.org/lib/typesseq-strings.html">Python
            string formatting</A> works since %(name)s uses both the regular

            <LI>Mail me the resulting <TT>yourlanguage.po</TT> file. I will
            include it into %(name)s.

'''    <H3>Frequently asked questions</H3>
    <P><I>I upgraded to a new version and now I cannot load my %(name)s file. It
    says: "Error loading <myfile>.tsk. Are you sure it is a %(name)s file?".
    I'm sure the file's ok. What next?</I></P>
    <P>Remove your TaskCoach.ini file and try again. Sometimes errors in
    loading old settings files will cause %(name)s to barf on .tsk files that
    are just fine. The TaskCoach.ini file is located in C:\Documents and
    Settings\&lt;yourname&gt;\Application Data\TaskCoach if you're on Windows 
    and in /home/&lt;yourname&gt;/.TaskCoach if you're on Linux.</P>
    <P><I>Can I track effort for more than one task at the same
    time?</I></P>
    <P>Yes, when you are tracking effort for a task, select the second
    task, right-click and select 'New effort...'. When you don't fill in
    an end-time, effort for that second task will be tracked too.</P>
    <P><I>I'm on Linux, using a window manager with virtual desktops. If
    I switch (back) to the virtual desktop where %(name)s was running, I can 
    no longer find it. Where did %(name)s go?</I></P>
    <P>%(name)s is probably minimized. Look for the little %(name)s icon
    in the system tray, click on it with your right mouse button and
    select 'Restore'.  Apparently, switching between virtual desktops is
    implemented by sending a minimize event to applications.
    Unfortunately, %(name)s has no way to distinguish between minimize
    events caused by the window manager and minimize events caused by
    the user minimizing the window. If you run into this issue, you may
    want to change the setting 'Hide main window when iconized', see
    'Edit' -> 'Preferences'.</P>
    <P><I>How can I mark a task 'inactive'?</I></P>
    <P>Set the start date of the task to a future data or don't set 
    a start date at all by unchecking the start date check box.</P>
'''

pages['roadmap'] = \
'''    <h3>%(name)s roadmap</h3>
    <p>My aim for %(name)s is to be a personal assistent that helps with
    the daily chores of life: remembering things to do, registering
    hours spent on projects, taking notes, etc. It should also be as
    intuitive as possible for users to deal with and not require any technical
    knowledge.</p>
    <p>Currently, %(name)s knows about three domain concepts: tasks, 
    effort, and categories. Other domain concepts that might be added 
    in the future include note and contact person.</p>
    <p>In the long run, it might be worthwile to allow
    users to add their own concepts. So, for example, if you want to keep
    a list of books to read you could define a book concept and accompanying
    fields like author, title, isbn, read/unread status, etc. That would
    also need the file format to be very flexible.</p>
    <p>Currently, the focus of %(name)s is to support single users. In the long
    run, support for exchange of tasks with other users should be possible,
    probably via the iCalendar standard.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this is it for now, I'll add more as soon as my thoughts
    on the subject crystalize into a more coherent picture of the future 
    direction for %(name)s.</p>
'''

pages['devinfo'] = \
'''    <h3>Information for developers</h3>
    <p>Here's some information for developers that either want to hack
    on %(name)s or reuse code.</p>
    <h4>Dependencies</h4>
    <p>%(name)s is developed in <A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>,
    using <A HREF="http://www.wxpython.org">wxPython</A> for the
    graphical user interface. The few other libraries (other than those
    provided by Python and wxPython) that are used are put into the
    taskcoachlib/thirdparty package and included in the CVS
    repository.</p>
    <h4>Getting the source</h4>
    <p>%(name)s source code is hosted at <A
    HREF="https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=130831">SourceForge</A>.
    You can check out the code from CVS directly or <A
    HREF="http://taskcoach.cvs.sourceforge.net/taskcoach/">browse the
    repository</A>.</p>
    <h4>Tests</h4>
    <p>Tests can be run from the Makefile. There are targets for
    <tt>unittests</tt>, <tt>integrationtests</tt>,
    <tt>releasetests</tt>, and <tt>alltests</tt>. These targets all
    invoke the tests/test.py script. Run <tt>tests/test.py --help</tt> for 
    many more test options (including profiling, timing, measuring test 
    coverage, etc.).</p>
    <h4>Building the distributions</h4>
    <p>The Makefile is used to build the different distributions of
    %(name)s. Currently, a Windows installer is built, a Mac OSX dmg
    file, and the sources are packaged as compressed archives (.zip and 
    .tar.gz). The Makefile contains targets for each of the
    distributions. Most of the code for the actual building of the
    distributions, using the python distutils package, is located in 
    make.py. In turn, make.py imports setup.py. These two files were
    split so that setup.py only contains distutils information related
    to <i>installing</i>, while make.py contains all information related
    to <i>building</i> the distributions. Only setup.py is included in
    the source distributions.</p>
    <h5>Windows</h5>
    <p>On Windows, py2exe is used to bundle the application with the python
    interpreter and wxPython libraries. Innosetup is used to create an
    executable installer. 
    All the necessary packaging code is in make.py
    and driven from the Makefile (<tt>windist</tt> target).</p>
    <h5>Mac OSX</h5>
    <p>On Mac OSX, py2app is used to bundle the application. The resulting
    application is packaged into a dmg file using the <tt>hdiutil</tt>
    utility, which is part of Mac OSX. 
    All the necessary packaging code is in make.py
    and driven from the Makefile (<tt>macdist</tt> target).</p>
    <h5>Linux</h5>
    <p>I create RPM and DEB distributions on Ubuntu (<tt>lindist</tt> target).
    Alternatively, Linux users that have installed python and wxPython
    themselves (if not installed by default) can also use the source
    distribution. The source distributions are created by the
    <tt>sdist</tt> Makefile target.</p>
    <h4>Coding style</h4>
    <p>Class names are StudlyCaps. Method names are camelCase, except
    for wxPython methods that are called or overridden because those are
    StudlyCaps. At first I thought that was ugly, a mixture of two
    styles. But it turned out to be quite handy, since you can easily
    see whether some method is a wxPython method or not.</p>
