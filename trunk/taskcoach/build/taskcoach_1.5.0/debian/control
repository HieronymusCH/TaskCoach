Description: Your friendly task manager.
 Task Coach is a free open source todo manager. It grew out of frustration
 about other programs not handling composite tasks well. In addition to
 flexible composite tasks, Task Coach has grown to include prerequisites,
 prioritizing, effort tracking, category tags, budgets, notes, and many
 other features. However, users are not forced to use all these features;
 Task Coach can be as simple or complex as you need it to be. Task Coach is
 available for Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux; and there is a companion
 iOS app.
