Task Coach - Your friendly task manager
================================================================


--- Prerequisites ----------------------------------------------

You need Python version 2.6 or higher, wxPython 
version 2.8.9.2-unicode or higher, and Twisted version
10.0 or higher.


--- Testing ----------------------------------------------------

Before installing, you may want to run the unittests included.
Issue the following command:

  cd tests; python test.py

If all goes well, you should see a number of dots appearing and
the message 'Ran X tests in Y seconds. OK'. If not, you'll get
one or more failed tests. In that case, please run the tests
again, redirecting the output to a textfile, like this:

  python test.py 2> errors.txt

Please mail me the errors.txt file and your platform information
(operating system version, Python version and wxPython version).


--- Installation -----------------------------------------------

There are two options to install Task Coach: 

First, you can simply move this directory to some suitable 
location and run taskcoach.py (or taskcoach.pyw if you are on 
the Windows platform) from there.

Alternatively, you can use the Python distutils setup script
to let Python install Task Coach for you. In that case run the
following command:

  python setup.py install

If you have a previous version of Task Coach installed, you may
need to force old files to be overwritten, like this:

  python setup.py install --force
